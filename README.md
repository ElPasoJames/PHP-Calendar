# PHP-Calendar

THIS CODE IS NOT TESTED LIVE YET AND IS CURRENTLY BEING BUILT !!!!!!

This project is to build a calendar that is internally managed using PHP and SQL (can be direct File Manager used or Rest API for a Widget or Snippet). As a back note, the platform is used by hundreds of independent contract professional services (User) individuals that pay a small fee to promote their small business. The new fee structure will be a portion of each booking being help by the website and the remaining immediatley sent to the independent contract via stripe. The ENTIRE calendar will be managed directly on the website and does not connect third party calendar services.

What the final code will have the folowing features:

Independent Contractor (User)
Manage availability time
Ability to Cancel or reschule appointments
Get notified via Email of new appointments
SMS notification of appointment
User will have clean UI to manage calendar
Show upcoming appointments on user dashboard
Establish minimum time needed between appointments

Customer
View User Calendar
Schedule with a professional(user)
Ability to reschedule appointment
Contact User for basic questions
Email notification of email
SMS notification of email

Stripe
User will be paid via stripe immediately upon good payment (90%) as primary Stripe Account. They will need to provide their Stripe API info
Website will be paid immediately (10%) as a secondary to user. 

The Stripe concept is to push the charge back issue on the User and to eliminate any risk involved if a professional contractor causes any issues legally such a fraud for example.
